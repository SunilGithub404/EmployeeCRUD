6. Used Entity Framework Core to interact with database.
7. Used in-memory database and EF code first approach
8. Used Dependency Injection.

10. Added a REST endpoint that takes a search input then returns a list of employees whoâ€™s first or last
name matches

That is why i used in memory code first database and repository.
